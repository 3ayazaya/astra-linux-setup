## Using git to get the playbook

I recommend using the [git](https://git-scm.com/) tool to get the playbook's source code.

Once you've installed git on your computer, you can go to any directory of your choosing and run the following command to retrieve the playbook's source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3ayazaya/astra-linux-setup.git
```

This will create a new `astra-linux-setup` directory.
You're supposed to execute all other installation commands inside that directory.
